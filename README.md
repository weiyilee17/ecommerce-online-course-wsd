# What is this project?

This is a NextJS v14 E-commerce website for selling downloadable online courses following wds's tutorial. The focus of this tutorial is on learning stripe, react-email, and resend, though the schema is also worth thinking through.

The db started in using SQLite, but changed to MySQL for enums, it could be anything though.

There are a lot of duplication in this tutorial. If there are needs to expand this project, refactoring would be needed
